# configure is writing to config.log, and then calls config.status.
# config.status does its own redirection, appending to config.log.
# Unfortunately, on DOS this fails, as config.log is still kept open
# by configure, so config.status won't be able to write to it; its
# output is simply discarded.  So we exec the FD to /dev/null,
# effectively closing config.log, so it can be properly (re)opened and
# appended to by config.status.  When coming back to configure, we
# need to make the FD available again.
